## History
November 16, 2021
   upgraded to angular 10.2.5

November 17, 2021
Connectors now have separate pages so it is easier to add additional connectors
/app/connector           <- main page
/app/connector/mysql     <- mysql connector page
/app/connector/sqlserver <- sql server connector page

moved src/main/resources/application.yml out of the jar file
renamed application.yml to application.properties
